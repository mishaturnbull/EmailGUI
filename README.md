# EmailGUI

In short, a Python script that emails people many times.

## Usage

Allows users to send people a theoretically unlimited amount of emails in one
sitting.  There are limitations, but there are also workarounds.  Ever had that
special someone who just needed another thousand emails?

### Basic

`$ python EmailGUI.py` gives you a graphical interface that has been tested on
Windows, macOS, and Linux.  It should in theory work on any platform that
supports Python's Tkinter library.

### Advanced

I'll get to this section later.  Should be pretty easy to figure out from
looking at the code's argument section.
