# EmailGUI

The one, and the only, publicly open-source email spambot.

# Dislaimer

I did not write this to do bad things.  I wrote it to stress-test an email 
server.  I do not take any responsibility for how this code is used by anybody
other than myself.  Don't do bad things.  This code makes it really easy to
accidently perform illegal activities, and you shouldn't do that.

## Usage

Allows users to send people a theoretically unlimited amount of emails in one
sitting.  There are limitations, but there are also workarounds.  

### Basic

`$ python EmailGUI.py` gives you a graphical interface that has been tested on
Windows, macOS, and Linux.  It should in theory work on any platform that
supports Python's Tkinter library.

Type in your message, or just use the default, then hit Email, and Send!  Now
features an abort mechanism in case the victi..er, recipient begs for 
forgiveness partway through.
