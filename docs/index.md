# EmailGUI Basics

EmailGUI is a user-friendly(ish) mass mail generator.  Its job is to send a lot of emails to 1 address, to test spam filters or email servers.  It is quite good at this.

## Downloads & Releases

Right now, EmailGUI is in a pseudo-beta stage.  I'm adding features and improving old code continously.  As advertised in the `__version__.py` file, we're technically at 1.1.6 and 1.2 should be a good step up after which I'll start using GitHub's releases/branching properly.  For now, just clone the master branch and you'll get what you get.

## Help

For help, you can either browse around this GitHub Pages site (recommended) or use the included Help page, which is more accessible albiet a bit outdated.  That can be found by clicking on the `Help` tab and then selecting `Documentation`.

The `Send` button is located under the `Email` menu in the top-left corner.
